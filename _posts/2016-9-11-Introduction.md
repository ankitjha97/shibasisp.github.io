   Finally, I made my mind to write a blog. After struggling so much to write something, I realized that even if you have too much to say and express, it’s just your words that the world counts.

   Writing this blog not only improve my writing but also make a log of activities done by me. Here, I will share whatever I learn, whatever problems I encountered and How I solved them. This blog will be more inclined towards Linux, Python/Ruby lovers and open source enthusiast. 
It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.
